# Calculator app made using Python & PyQt5

This is a simple calculator implemented using Python 3 and with a [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/introduction.html) GUI. It implements the most basic math operations, that is, division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction.

This is intended to be a demonstrative example on how you can implement a Python + PyQt5 GUI application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## Requirements

You need to have a proper installation of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.6 and PyQt5 library in your system. PyQt5 can be installed using `pip3` as follows:

```console
$ sudo pip3 install pyqt5
```

**Note**: For more information on how to install PyQt5, you can take a look at the installation section in the [project's documentation](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html).

## How to Run Calculator app

To run this app, open your system's command-line and execute the following command:

```console
$ python3 calc.py
```

After running this command, you'll see the calculator running on your screen and you can try it out.
